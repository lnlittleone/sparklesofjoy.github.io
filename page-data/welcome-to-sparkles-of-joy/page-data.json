And trust me, I know this well since I started numerous blogs (and never succeeded to keep them but… that’s another story). \n\n  So why start a blog now ? \n\n It itches me for quite a time, I launched this one a year ago and never used it. I wanted to do something for me, create a space to share literally everything and anything, pieces of life that brings me joy. I love lots of things and I like to share what I’m learning.I thought a blog could be a good way to practice this sharing with other people :).   \n\nMy job is being a front-end developer so I’ll probably talk about coding, being a woman in software development, cuz… we are so few ! Also about crafting, travels, home reno (I just finished my house after more than a year of renovation, that was long), food, gardening (maybe). Well, life stuff.\n\n  I hope you’ll enjoy this little journey with me.\n See you ! \n"},"gallery":null,"name":"Welcome to Sparkles of Joy","related":null,"summary":"My corner of internet where I'm talking about... everything.
